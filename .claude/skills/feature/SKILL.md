# Feature Workflow

Manages the full lifecycle of a feature from spec to merge.

## Working File

@context/current-feature.md

### File Structure

current-feature.md has these sections:

- `# Current Feature` - H1 heading with feature name when active
- `## Status` - Not Started | In Progress | Complete
- `## Goals` - Bullet points of what success looks like
- `## Notes` - Additional context, constraints, or details from spec
- `## History` - Completed features (append only)

## Task

Execute the requested action: $ARGUMENTS

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `load` | Load a feature spec or inline description |
| `start` | Begin implementation, create branch |
| `review` | Check goals met, code quality |
| `explain` | Document what changed and why |
| `complete` | Commit, push, merge, reset |

See [actions/](actions/) for detailed instructions.

If no action provided, explain the available options.

## Task Tracking

Before executing an action, use TaskCreate to add one task per numbered step in that action's instructions (see [actions/](actions/)). Mark each task in_progress as you start it and completed immediately after finishing it — don't batch updates. This keeps the todo list visible to the user throughout the action.
